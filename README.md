# social-notifier
## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

In addition, new projects will also need to set up:

* A [Reddit API client](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps)
    * You may use the simpler "script" app type, unless you have additional reasons not to
    * Recommend you follow the "first steps" from [Reddit's quickstart](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2-Quick-Start-Example#first-steps)
    * For more, see Reddit's [API wiki](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/API)
* A [Twitter API client](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps)
    * You **must** use "user auth" for firehose access (i.e. you cannot use "application-only" auth)
    * To quickly generate a user access token + secret follow [these instructions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/guides/access-tokens)
    * For more, see Twitter's [Developer docs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)
* A [Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps)
    * You will need to configure the "Post to specific channels" (`incoming-webgook`) scope
    * You may also need to configure the "Send messages as..." (`chat:write:bot`) scope

## Installation

* `git clone <repository-url>` this repository
* `cd social-notifier`
* `yarn install`
* `cp .env.example .env`
    * Make sure to replace all sample values with the relevant credentials and config variables

## Configuration
Configuration for all social services is set up in `.yml` files in the data directory.

### Reddit
* Config file: [`data/subreddits.yml`](https://github.com/chefconnie/social-notifier/blob/master/data/subreddits.yml)
* Structure:
    ```
    subreddit_name:
      - search term 1
      - comma,seperated,means,boolean,OR
      - space seperated, means booleand AND
    AskReddit:
      - plumbus
      - pan-galactic gargle blaster
    ```

### Twitter
* Config file: `data/twitter.yml`
* Structure:
    ```
    - is_question: true
      terms: comma,separated,means,boolean,or
    - terms:
      - space separated,means boolean and
      - use multiple bullets,to combine boolean or
    ```

In the above example, each top-level YAML entry is considered a "query object". If you are filtering for only one query object, you may omit bullets for the top-level object ONLY.

## Running / Development
### Developing
* `yarn run build`
* `yarn run start` (iff already built)

### Building
* `yarn run build`

### Deploying
#### First Deploy
Unfortunately, this app will not work on Glitch, because 1) either Reddit or `snoowrap` doesn't like Glitch's runtime; and 2) Glitch will not keep your app alive in the background > 5m anyway ðŸ˜¢

Instead, create (or SSH into) a server, e.g. on DigitalOcean or AWS. If this is your first time creating a server, we recommend following DigitalOcean's [security + usability guidelines](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-18-04).

Then, we recommend following the [CertSimple Linux deployment guide](https://certsimple.com/blog/deploy-node-on-linux), and using the pre-written `notifier.service` file in this repo. The next section assumes you have followed this guide, and cloned the project into `/var/local/social-notifier`.

#### Subsequent Changes
* `ssh user@sub.host.com`
* `cd /var/local/social-notifier`
* `git pull`
* `yarn && yarn run build`
* `sudo systemctl restart notifier`

Since `.env` is gitignored, you will need to set production environment variables manually, e.g. by
* Configuring them natively on the server;
* Using `scp` or `rsync` to publish your `.env` file to the server separately; or
* Copying values into a server-side `.env` file manually

#### Misc
To view server logs:
```bash
sudo journalctl --follow -u notifier
```

## Planned Improvements
The following items are listed in priority order. PRs very welcome!

* Support for URLs as search terms, especially for Twitter
    * URLs in tweet text are replaced with shortened `t.co` links
    * Suggest adding a `url` or `urls` attribute to YAML; filtering on `${origin}${path}` concatenation; and matching `${origin}${path}` on URL entities' [`expanded_url`](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/data-dictionary/overview/entities-object#urls)
* Caching last-received results on the server's YAML file
    * (currently some Reddit notifications may be duplicated on restart)
